usbd_rom_msc_EEPROM 
================

In the latest LPCOpen release 2.08c for the LPCXpresso LPC1549 board there are
some examples on how to use USB ROM API, but there are no example on how to use
USB mass storage device class.
 
Here I present "missing" USB Mass storage examples:

* EEPROM.
* RAM.
* Flash memory.
* SD/MMC card.
